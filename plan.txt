1: making better file time save
    solution 1:
        step 1:
            use the save sys that plus the previous like this :
                [162354584765,85,69,32,35,36]
                    162354584765 + 85
                    162354584765 + 69
            and every 500 save new full epoc time
        step 2:
            we need way to tell the program that this index is time to use or this index is the number to plus
                let put r to the real time number
                   [r162354584765,85,69,32,35,36]
                problem : we need to save the tim list so if it contains r it going to be -> str, but we want -> int
                    solution : run for loop that decode the time list

    solution 2:
        idea:
            since we get the information every 30 sec we can just plus constant number to the first time and reset the time every 500 or sum
                ( 1648557395728[index 0] - 1648557365724[index 1]) =  30004
            the problem that could happen with this is that the time are gonna be different so the time will not be correct

    solution 3: ---> use this one!
        idea :
            save one list of epoctime since the start of the date collection
            problem :
                the item that get insert after will be unscy with the time
                solution :
                    store the start index of time to each item
                    step 1: when use the (create_bazzar_file()) function we read json from ('bazzar_static_file.json') we can use the [lastUpdate] time information to set the start index of item time
                        problem : it override the old information
                            solution make new function to chekc if the key already exit
                                if yes:
                                    ignore
                                else(no):
                                    append new key and dict
